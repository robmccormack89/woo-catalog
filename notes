1. be cool if woo archive's featured image was a random one from the current queried product's featured images. if none, then use the default.

2. single product metas logic....

  Ranges (attribute: range)

    can be in a parent or a sub (blinds -> roller)
    can be in 2 at collections at once like roller & vertical. e.g: variable products

    check the terms the product has attached...

    if terms contain children...

      if term is a child, show other products within this term --- roller products carousel, minus current product

      if term is a child, show other products within this term --- vertical products carousel, minus current product

      get parents of all children in terms & remove any duplicates. loop thru parents and....

        if parent has subs, show the subs minus the product's attached subs (roller & vertical) --- carousel with subs of blinds (venetain, day-night...)

        if parent has subs, show the subs minus the product's attached subs --- carousel with subs of shutters (there is none, just maybe....)

    elseif terms contains no children...

      if term is a parent & the parent has NO subs, show other products within the parent term (minus current product) --- shutters products

      if term is a parent & the parent has NO subs, show other products within the parent term (minus current product) --- blinds, maybe

      if term is a parent & the parent has subs, show the subs --- blinds -> vertical, venetian etc... maybe

  Collections (product_cat)

    can be in a parent or a sub (perfect-fit -> softshade)
    will only ever be in 1 range (or parent/child range-set) at once.

  Features (product_tag)

    loop thru the product features as a carousel

    maybe give motorized its own section if product has that as feature etc
